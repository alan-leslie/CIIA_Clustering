Java program to compare clustering algorithms when applied to personal bokmarks.

Using code from the books:
collective inteligence in action - ISBN: 1933988312
algorithms of the intelligent web - ISBN: 1933988665

Adapted to work with web page data created by BookMarkCrawler 
and analysed by TextAnalysis.
For each type of clustering algorithm ouputs an XML file that can be imported into - 
Archaeopteryx (http://www.phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/)
which does a really good of displaying dendograms.

Note: built with netbeans.
